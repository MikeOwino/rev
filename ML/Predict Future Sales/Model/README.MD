# **Predict Future Sales**

**GOAL**

- The task is to forecast the total amount of products sold in every shop for the test set. Note that the list of shops and products slightly changes every month. Creating a robust model that can handle such situations is part of the challenge.


**DATASET**

Dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/competitive-data-science-predict-future-sales/data).



**WHAT I HAD DONE**

- Step 1: Data Preprocessing & Exploration
- Step 3: Data Training & Model Creation
- Step 4: Performance Evaluation

**MODELS USED**

-  Linear Regression
-  Random Forest Regressor


**LIBRARIES NEEDED**

- numpy
- pandas
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- Labelencoder

**Accuracy of different models used**

By using Linear Regression I got 
 ```python
    Test set Accuracy:   0.42878283190980937
 ``` 

By using Random Forest Regressor I got 
 ```python
    Test set Accuracy:  0.9324485724217306
 ``` 
 
 **CONCLUSION**

Performance of  random forest regressor is better in terms of accuracy as compared to linear regression.
